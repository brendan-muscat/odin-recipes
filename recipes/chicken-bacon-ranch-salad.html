<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>chicken</li>
    <li>bacon</li>
    <li>romaine</li>
    <li>tomatoes</li>
    <li>cucumbers</li>
    <li>avocado</li>
    <li>red onion</li>
    <li>ranch dressing</li>
    <li>lemon juice</li>
    <li>garlic powder</li>
    <li>dried dill</li>
    <li>dried parsley</li>
    <li>salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large zipper-topped plastic baggie or a shallow dish, add the chicken, all of the spices, vinegar of
        choice, and oil. Close the bag and use your hands to mix everything together. If you are using a shallow dish,
        use tongs to work the spices evenly into the chicken. You can let this rest for up to a half hour or work with
        it right away. I like to let it rest a minute to increase the flavor.</li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. When the skillet is hot, add the chicken. Cook for 13-15
        minutes, turning once, until the chicken is cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and let it rest for
        10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>While the chicken cooks, add your salad greens to a shallow serving bowl. Top with tomatoes, bell pepper, bacon,
        cucumber, and red onion. When the chicken is cool, slice it into thin strips and add it to the salad.</li>
    <li>You can dress the salad with Litehouse Homestyle Ranch Dressing before serving or have everyone serve themselves
        and then dress as they like - it's up to you.</li>
